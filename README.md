# Health Insights Brazil - Data Platform Project

![Status Badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=STATUS&message=INCOMPLETE&color=FFCC00)

## 📁 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world Data Engineering solution for Health Insights Brazil, a startup focused on optimizing public health data analysis from DataSUS. The goal is to build an end-to-end data pipeline using Databricks (Delta Lake) and dbt, following cloud architecture best practices, with adaptability to Snowflake environments.

## 💡 Problem Statement

DataSUS provides massive volumes of public health data, but the lack of structured, timely insights hinders hospitals, researchers, and policymakers. The objective of this project is to:

* Ingest raw data from DataSUS into a cloud Data Lake.

* Transform and model data into an analytical schema.

* Ensure data quality and documentation.

* Provide a reliable data foundation for reporting and insights.

## 📋 Project Kanban

You can follow the development workflow and current project status through the **Health Insights Brazil - Data Engineering Workflow** board on GitHub Projects:

➡️ [View Kanban Board on GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/pathilink/projects/2)

This Kanban tracks tasks across the full data pipeline lifecycle:
- Data ingestion (DataSUS to Delta Lake)
- dbt transformations and data modeling
- Orchestration plans and CI/CD improvements
- Documentation and innovation tasks (dashboards, privacy strategies)

Status columns include **To Do, In Progress, Done** to provide a transparent view of the workflow.
